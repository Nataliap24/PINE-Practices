      Message to send to the server: <br>
      <input type="text" name="msg">
      <input type="submit" value="SEND">
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

<! the form function is the mechanism we have to create the form inside of it we can create the inputs.
First we make the "message to send.." message appear on the screen
the first input has two attributes:
       type that tells what is the actual thing that is going to be displayed (when putting text, we ask the browser to put a thing to write in it)
       the name attribute is for the browser to know how to send that information to the server. In the url msg="the thing we wrote" appears bc we wrote the echo action**
For the second input:
        the submit type creates the send button
        the value=send writes "send" inside the button

** by saying action="echo", we imply that something will attend the echo request for the server
Example: echo?msg=abcdefg for the key msg, the value is abcdefg

the method="get" function ???
